# SSO OAuth2 Vanila
 
This is just prove of concept of *Single Sign On* or *SSO* implemented as separated to 3 applications. 
Based on Spring Cloud oauth2 and docker, I put everything up here so we can just `docker-compse up`  

### Authorization 

This is where we authenticate and authorize users maintaning Token for all. 

### Resource

Providing resources is the main purpose of this application but with help or OAuth2 we can secure our resource services.

### UI Application

This is a last piece to show that not only private but 3rd part application can embed secured resources through OAuth2.

### How 

Coming soon!
